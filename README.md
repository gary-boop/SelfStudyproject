### Data Visualization:
Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually, so they can grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns. The way the human brain processes information using charts or graphs to visualize large amounts of complex data is easier than poring over spreadsheets or reports. Data visualization is a quick, easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner.

Visual communication breaks down barriers that verbal communication simply can’t. Cultural differences, for example, can seriously hinder verbal communication – especially if you’re dealing with a language barrier between the sender and receiver. Visual aids (charts and graphs), overcomes this. Complex concepts and ideas are also easier to communicate when presented visually. 

### Effective Visualization:
Good data visualization should both engage the audience and improve both the accuracy and the depth of their understanding.
Following are the key points that make a good visualization:
* Context
  * Know your audience
  * Easy to interpret
*	Color
*	Movement

**Context**: When developing a visualization, you need to establish context. Context can help create a relationship between your data and the audience. Furthermore, context helps to establish connections between seemingly random data sets. If you were just to present two sets of numbers without giving them context, your audience might be confused. However, when you provide a backstory for each set, they’ll be able to see the relationship and understand how each is affected by the other. 

Knowing your audience is also key to convey information in a contextual aspect. You should know who you are designing it for and the actions the audience need to take with the insights.

The visualization should also be easy to interpret. Users should be able to quickly understand high-level overview information and help themselves to more information as needed.

**Color**: Emphasize important data by drawing the user’s attention to it using colors, size, negative space, or contrast. When people see data, they quickly become overwhelmed, even if the numbers are presented in a pie chart or bar graph. Color helps break up huge chunks of information into digestible bites. Patterns are ideal for displaying similar sets of information, or multiple sets of data that equal in value. If you have several sets of similar data and want to avoid emphasizing one over the others, establish a “pattern” by using similar objects, colors, and chart types to display the information.

**Movement**: The movement principle draws the viewer’s attention in a certain direction which means people read from left to right, starting at the top of the page. You can emphasize certain data points by placing them where you know users will naturally look first: the top-left corner.

### Analyzing 5 visualizations on Climate change using the above framework:
#### 1.	CO2 concentration from 2011-2016:
![CO2 concentration](https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/images/2017/07/400PMM4Eva_720_492_s_c1_c_c.jpg)
  
Context, Colors and Movement are all covered to in this image. 
*	Title and key are defined at the top of the chart
*	Colors shows the CO2 concentration by year covering a span of two months. We can see the variation in CO2 concentration each month, each year. The changing color scale shows the increase in CO2 concentration and the dark color above 400PPM shows how severe it has become
*	In terms of content this chart paints a clear picture and the audience gets the message what the author wants to convey
*	This is a great image as it checks all the effective evaluation points 

#### 2.	Human activity drives climate change:
![Human activity](https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/images/2017/07/AR5_SYR_Figure_1.jpg?itok=xhxht0fx)
 
*	This image is not easy to interpret. Axes are unknown which leaves scope for ambiguity 
*	The audience needs knowledge of box plots to understand what the message the author is trying to convey
*	The use of colors doesn’t signify anything as the labels are next to each boxplot
*	The author found that “almost two-thirds of the impacts related to atmospheric and ocean temperature can be confidently attributed to anthropogenic forcing” (meaning human caused drivers). But this message is not conveyed to the full extent
*	This is not an effective image

#### 3.	Level of warming:
![Level of warming](https://wriorg.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/uploads/carbon_budget_cropped.png)

*	The author has provided context to explain the visualization 
*	The use of colors seems effective as the audience can clearly understand the changes shown in the globes. We have just 485 PgC budget left and that is going to expire by year 2045 if emissions are not controlled
*	In terms of movement, author has included information all over the image. The audience have to understand the definition of carbon budget in order to understand what is shown in the 2 globes below. The definition of carbon budget could be shortened as it makes the entire image look a bit boring
*	By repeating the globe, author communicates the relationship between the globes, saying they have something in common
*	Overall, this is a good image

#### 4.	Global temperature Anomalies:
![Global temperature Anomalies](http://ossfoundation.us/projects/environment/global-warming/human-caused/image)
*	The axes are easily understood and clear, image key is defined in top left
*	The different colors show which factors have contributed to the increase in global temperature. The dark lines are the mean and the light shades are the variation. Author should have provided some explanation of this effect
*	Moreover, the trend is that the temperature is increasing every decade. The author could have shown the info. for years 1960 – 2000. This would have made the image more clear and easier to digest. The audience seems to be lost and needs to spend more time understanding the image to understand the author’s message

#### 5.	Cumulative CO2 emissions:
![Cumulative CO2 emissions](https://webpages.scu.edu/ftp/ghassija/images/illu_4.png)
*	Information is conveyed within 5 seconds when someone views this image
*	Colors accurately show which countries emit the most CO2 until 2016, darker the color, higher the emissions
*	The color scale moves from left-right which is good in terms of movement principle
*	Overall, this is a great visualization 

### Conclusion:
Good data visualization can improve the quality of insights gleaned from data and the effectiveness to communicate those insights.  As a lot of effort is spent pursuing a data-driven culture, good data visualization becomes invaluable.

By following the evaluation framework, the quality of graphics can be improved. Use of colors and making graphics with some context will help in creating high quality visualizations. Authors should not overuse colors or overload the audience with information as it lowers quality and makes the visualizations boring; audience will have to invest more time in understanding the image. Authors should try to keep visualizations simple and easy to interpret. Authors should not create visualizations on assumptions, this lowers the quality of the image.
